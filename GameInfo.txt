About Game
This game is an endless zombie survival game where your main goal is just to see how long you can survive. Each round the zombie’s speed increases. Health regen is high so the only real way to die is to get overrun. Headshots are a one shot kill and body shots take 4 shots. Zombies health is 100, while in game you can see damage numbers.

Weird Bug
When I tested game in editor you could not jump off map but in packaged product you can for some reason, so I just added a hotkey to restart level if you do (T).
