About Game:

This game is an endless zombie survival game where your main goal is just to see how long you can survive. Each round the zombie’s speed increases. Health regen is high so the only real way to die is to get overrun. Headshots are a one shot kill and body shots take 4 shots. Zombies health is 100, while in game you can see damage numbers.
Game was built solely using Unreal Engine built in visual scripting tools called "blueprints".
